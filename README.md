# Squeezme

Webpage width resizer **menubar** for developers (uses jQuery). Adds a _Squeezme_ menubar to the top of any page displayed through the iframe in the browser. The required HTML, CSS and JS is all in the one HTML file.

Demo: [http://simonpadbury.github.io/Squeezme/](http://simonpadbury.github.io/Squeezme/) â€“ notice the red menubar at the top of the window.

_Squeezme_ may be all you need for demonstrating how your website appars at different screen widths.

It's all included in a single file - except for requiring jQuery (served by Cloudfire CDN) and Dosis, a Google Font.

Just link to your webpage in the `<iframe src=" ">` and away you go.

You can edit or add to the `squeezmeWidth`'s within the jQuery script at the end of the HTML page.
