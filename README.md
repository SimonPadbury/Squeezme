Webpage width resizer for developers (uses jQuery). The required HTML, CSS and JS is all in the one HTML file.

Demo: [http://simonpadbury.github.io/Squeezme/](http://simonpadbury.github.io/Squeezme/)

Squeezme may be all you need for demonstrating how your website appars at different screen widths.

It's all included in a single file - except for requiring jQuery (served by Cloudfire CDN) and Dosis, a Google Font.

Just link to your webpage in the <iframe src=" "> and away you go.

You can edit or add to the squeezmeWidths within the jQuery script at the end of the HTML page.
